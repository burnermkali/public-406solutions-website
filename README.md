README

This bash script installs and configures Docker, Git, Nginx, and Docker Compose on a Ubuntu system. It also sets up a Flask application in production mode using Gunicorn and Supervisor, and configures NGINX to proxy traffic to the Flask app.

To use this script, make sure you have the required dependencies installed on your system and update the /path/to/flask/app and <your_secret_key> placeholders with the appropriate values. Then, run the script with sudo bash script.sh.

Note: This script assumes that your system is running Ubuntu and has the apt-get package manager installed. It may not work on other operating systems or with other package manager
